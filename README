We guess github is all the rage these days, so we've moved what we have for the
PSUBot here for now. Sometimes we hack on it, so maybe this will be easier to
keep up to date. Or maybe we'll collaborate, or something.

A lot of this is not so useful without hardware schematics. Those might appear
at some point, too.
